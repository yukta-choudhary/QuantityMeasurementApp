### 📅 UC1 : Feet Measurement Equality
(17-02-2026)

- Implements value-based equality comparison for measurements in feet.
- Two Feet objects are considered equal if their numerical values are equal.
- Key Concepts
  - Overriding equals() method
  - Using Double.compare() for floating-point comparison
  - Null and type safety checks
  - Encapsulation and immutability

### 📅 UC2 : Inch Measurement Equality
(18-02-2026)

- Implements value-based equality comparison for measurements in inches.
- Two Inch objects are considered equal if their numerical values are equal.
- Key Concepts
  - Overriding equals() method
  - Using Double.compare() for floating-point comparison
  - Null and type safety checks
  - Maintaining consistency with Feet equality design

### 📅 UC3 : Generic Quantity Length 

(19-02-2026)

* Refactors separate Feet and Inch classes into a single generic **Length** class.
* Eliminates code duplication using the **DRY principle**.
* Supports multiple units through an enum.
* Enables cross-unit comparison (e.g., 1 foot = 12 inches).
* Improves scalability and maintainability.

### 📅 UC4 : Extended Unit Support (Yards & Centimeters)

(20-02-2026)

* Extends the generic **Length** design to support additional units.
* Adds **Yards** and **Centimeters** using enum-based configuration.
* Enables comparison across all supported units (feet, inches, yards, centimeters).
* Demonstrates scalability with minimal code changes.
