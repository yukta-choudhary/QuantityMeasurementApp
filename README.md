- Maintains backward compatibility; all features from UC1–UC7 work without modifying client code.  
- Demonstrates principles like Single Responsibility, low coupling, high cohesion, and scalable architecture for future measurement categories.

### 📅 UC9 : WeightMeasurement 
(21-02-2026)

- Introduces a new **Weight** measurement category supporting kilogram, gram, and pound units.  
- Implements equality, conversion, and addition operations similar to the Length design.  
- Uses a standalone **WeightUnit** enum responsible for conversion to and from the base unit (kilogram).  
- Ensures immutability, validation, and precision while maintaining category type safety (weight ≠ length).  
- Demonstrates scalability and reusability of the architecture for multiple measurement categories.

- Introduces a common **IMeasurable** interface implemented by all unit enums (LengthUnit, WeightUnit).  
- Removes parallel QuantityLength and QuantityWeight classes, enforcing DRY and Single Responsibility principles.  
- Ensures type safety using generics while preventing cross-category comparison (length ≠ weight).  
- Establishes a scalable architecture where adding a new category only requires a new enum implementing **IMeasurable**, with no changes to the core Quantity class.

- Supports **equality comparison, unit conversion, and addition** for volume measurements similar to length and weight categories.  
- Ensures **type safety and category isolation**, preventing comparisons between volume, length, and weight measurements.  
- Validates the **scalability and reusability** of the generic design by adding a third category with minimal effort, proving DRY and extensibility.
